\section{Introduction}

This document presents a description of a static stellar structure model implemented in \texttt{Julia}, a high-performance dynamical programming language.  The accompanying code can be found at \url{https://github.com/adwasser/StarStruc.jl}.  For carefully considered initial guesses as to the boundary values, the code should converge on a structure model on the order of a few minutes.  For arbitrary initial guesses, the code will likely crash and burn.

\section{Background}

Stars are fearsome beasts, so we tame them by introducing some simplifying assumptions.  We model stars as non-rotating, time-independent, uniform composition, spherically symmetric cows.  Such domesticated animals still can pose numerical dangers to reckless star-cow wranglers, however.

We assume that the star is a fully ionized ideal gas, so its equation of state is
\[ P(\rho, T) = \frac{\rho}{\mu m_H} kT\]
where 
\[ \mu = \frac{1}{1 + 3X + Y/2} \]
is the dimensionless mean molecular weight for hydrogen mass fraction, $X$, and helium mass fraction, $Y$.  With this equation of state, our simple equations of stellar structure are
\begin{align*}
  \D{r}{m} &= \frac{1}{4\pi r^2 \rho} \\
  \D{\ell}{m} &= \epsilon_n \\
  \D{P}{m} &= -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^4} \\
  \D{T}{m} &= -\frac{GmT}{4\pi r^4P} \nabla
\end{align*}

Here, $\epsilon_n$ is the nuclear burning luminosity per unit mass, a quantity that is dependent on temperature, density and composition, 
\[ \nabla = \frac{T}{P}\D{T}{P} = 
  \begin{cases}
    \nabla_\text{ad} & \nabla_\text{rad} \ge \nabla_\text{ad} \\
    \nabla_\text{rad} & \nabla_\text{rad} < \nabla_\text{ad}
  \end{cases}
\]
For our assumed ideal gas, $\nabla_\text{ad} = 0.4$, and for a diffusive radiative transport model,
\[ \nabla_\text{rad} = \frac{3}{16\pi a c G}\frac{\kappa \ell P}{m T^4}\]
